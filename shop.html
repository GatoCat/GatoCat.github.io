## Shop

Welcome to GATO, a clothing store founded by Plaza LLama. This is a clothing store where the geeks become ballers and the ballers become geeks.  It’s inspired mainly by New York City’s multi-ethnic urban culture.  We hope you enjoy our apparel. <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>.
